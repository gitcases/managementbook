# Section C

I am not a killer.

I have a dark side, too. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me.

Tell him time is of the essence. I'm really more an apartment person. Only you could make those words cute. Cops, another community I'm not part of.
You look…perfect.

Only you could make those words cute. You look…perfect. Keep your mind limber. Cops, another community I'm not part of. I'm really more an apartment person. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client.

    Like a sloth. I can do that.
    You're a killer. I catch killers.
    Cops, another community I'm not part of.

I'm partial to air conditioning.

Watching ice melt. This is fun. I'm generally confused most of the time. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. This man is a knight in shining armor.

    He taught me a code. To survive.
    I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.
    Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen.

I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. I have a dark side, too. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.

I am not a killer. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. You look…perfect. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.

I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.

Makes me a … scientist. I like seafood. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. I'm really more an apartment person.

Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.
