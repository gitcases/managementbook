# Section A

Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king!

Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks *and* blows. I've had it with this school, Skinner. Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children…

    Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?*
    I stand by my racial slur.
    I was saying "Boo-urns."

Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals…except the weasel.

I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks *and* blows. I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks *and* blows. D'oh. Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?*

    Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies and then the baby looked at me.
    Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos.
    I'll be back. You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies.

Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?! Donuts. Is there anything they can't do? You don't win friends with salad.

Brace yourselves gentlemen. According to the gas chromatograph, the secret ingredient is… Love!? Who's been screwing with this thing? Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark.

I didn't get rich by signing checks. What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man? And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker. Donuts. Is there anything they can't do? Oh, so they have Internet on computers now!

Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world.

Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am not a crackpot. Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it. Dad didn't leave… When he comes back from the store, he's going to wave those pop-tarts right in your face!

Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get. The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… I'll be back. You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies.

No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it. Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three "Highlander" movies. Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work.

Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work. Kids, kids. I'm not going to die. That only happens to bad people. Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours.

I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks *and* blows. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals…except the weasel. I've done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff!

I was saying "Boo-urns." I'll be back. You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies. I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business.
