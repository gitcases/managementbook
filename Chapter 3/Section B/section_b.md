This is a fantastic little painting. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. A fan brush can be your best friend. That's crazy. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world.

Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Let all these things just sort of happen.

See there, told you that would be easy. You can spend all day playing with mountains. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Working it up and down, back and forth.

God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Let's have a happy little tree in here. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it.

It looks so good, I might as well not stop. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. We'll do another happy little painting. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Let's build an almighty mountain.

You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. It takes dark in order to show light. See there how easy that is. You can do anything your heart can imagine. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special.

You are only limited by your imagination. This piece of canvas is your world. We need a shadow side and a highlight side.
